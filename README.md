# HDC1080 Sensor Library

## ðŸ”„ Recovery and Modernization Project

This is a **recovery initiative** for the ClosedCube HDC1080 library that appears to have been abandoned and lost. My intention is to:

### ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

- **Rescue** a useful library that was lost or unmaintained
- **Update** the code for compatibility with modern Arduino IDE versions
- **Improve** documentation and usage examples
- **Optimize** performance and add new functionalities

### ðŸ“‹ Current Status

This library is based on the original ClosedCube work for the **Texas Instruments HDC1080** sensor, a high-precision, low-power digital humidity and temperature sensor.

**HDC1080 Sensor Features:**
- Digital humidity and temperature sensor
- High accuracy and low power consumption
- I2C interface
- Humidity range: 0% to 100% RH
- Temperature range: -20Â°C to +85Â°C
